Question 1: Based on what you know of how string
objects are stored in memory and variables, how 
many string objects have you created at this point?
Explain.
Only two unique memory addresses have been created




Question 2: Predict what happened to the value of
`stringThree` when you changed the value of 
`stringOne` at the end of the code. Why do 
you think that happens?
stringThree will become 93 because they reference the same memory address




Question 3: Now that you see the values of each of
the three variables, were you right in your prediction
in Question #2? Explain why or why not.
I was because I'm always right.




Question 4: How does reassigning a string variable
affect the original object it was pointing to?
It changes it.
