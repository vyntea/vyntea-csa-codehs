3. What value does the `width` attribute have in the
`Rectangle` class on line 4? Why? How does this relate
to the process of creating rectangle objects (lines

No value yet—it's set in the constructor when objects are created (e.g. width = 5 for rect1).



4. In summary, what is the difference between a class
and the objects it creates?
A class defines the structure; objects are actual instances with specific values.
